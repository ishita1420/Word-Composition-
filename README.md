# Word-Composition-

We need to find the first and second longest words that can be formed by concatenating other words from the same list. Additionally, we must calculate the time taken to find these words.

1)Firstly I have read the words from a file and remove the repeating words.
2)I have arrange the words in descending order according to their length.
3)Then I have check that the word is not empty if it is then I have return False.
4) Otherwise I have iterated and check for if prefix or suffix or compounded word is in a list that contain all word in a set
5)If it is there then I have return True else False
6)After that I have updated the longest and second longest word
7) I have calculated the time using formula(end time-start time)*1000
